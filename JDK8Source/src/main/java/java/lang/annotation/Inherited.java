/**
 * Indicates that an annotation type is automatically inherited.  If
 * an Inherited meta-annotation is present on an annotation type
 * declaration, and the user queries the annotation type on a class
 * declaration, and the class declaration has no annotation for this type,
 * then the class's superclass will automatically be queried for the
 * annotation type.  This process will be repeated until an annotation for this
 * type is found, or the top of the class hierarchy (Object)
 * is reached.  If no superclass has an annotation for this type, then
 * the query will indicate that the class in question has no such annotation.
 *
 * <p>Note that this meta-annotation type has no effect if the annotated
 * type is used to annotate anything other than a class.  Note also
 * that this meta-annotation only causes annotations to be inherited
 * from superclasses; annotations on implemented interfaces have no
 * effect.
 *
 * <p>
 *  表示注释类型是自动继承的。如果在注释类型声明上存在继承元注释,并且用户在类声明中查询注释类型,并且类声明没有该类型的注释,那么将自动查询该类的超类以获取注释类型。
 * 此过程将重复,直到找到此类型的注释,或达到类层次结构(Object)的顶部。如果没有超类具有此类型的注释,则查询将指示所讨论的类没有这样的注释。
